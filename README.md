New York City is known for its vast transportation system. Many residents utilize public transportation for everyday travel. However, there are times when every New Yorker faces the inconvenience of late transportation, whether it be buses or trains. Therefore, our group intends to focus on improving two bus routes (the S57 and the S78) in Staten Island that frequently incovenience many Staten Island residents, either by not arriving on-time or by not arriving at all for consecutive scheduled times.
